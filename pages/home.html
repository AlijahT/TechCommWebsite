                    <p id="story">
                        Waramaug Greens was founded in 2020 by Hugh Jesse, a software developer who lived and worked in
                        the
                        Netherlands for many years. When Covid hit, Jesse set out to find a new and exciting way to
                        enjoy
                        his
                        time. From this, the Virtual Reality experience was born. Jesse took his programming skills to
                        the
                        next
                        level, crafting intricate light shows, spacious gardens, and underwater escapes. However, this
                        was
                        only
                        the beginning of the Waramaug story.
                        Following the creation and distribution of these VR experiences, popularity quickly caught on
                        and
                        Jesse
                        began his team. The goal - to deliver the highest quality experiences in a new and innovative
                        way
                        that
                        hadnâ€™t previously been seen on the market. Following COVID 19, the Waramaug family continued
                        their
                        mission - offering a variety of services to bring people together and enjoy premium sourced
                        products
                        in
                        the best ways possible. By merging digital and physical space, something completely unique was
                        gifted to
                        the world.
